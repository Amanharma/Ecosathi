# ✅ Frontend-Backend Integration Complete!

## Current Status
Both your frontend and backend are now successfully integrated and running!

### 🚀 Servers Running
- **Backend**: `http://localhost:5000` ✅ Running
- **Frontend**: `http://localhost:5173` ✅ Running

### 🔧 Issues Fixed

1. **Frontend Server Configuration**
   - Changed from full-stack server to pure client-side application
   - Updated package.json scripts to use Vite instead of custom server
   - Removed conflicting server-side code

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Installed `cors` package that was missing
   - Added other necessary dependencies for the frontend

3. **Port Configuration**
   - Frontend correctly configured to connect to backend on port 5000
   - Backend running on port 5000 as expected

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Created proper `.env` files for both frontend and backend
   - Set correct API URL configuration

### 🎯 Integration Features Working

- ✅ **Authentication System**
  - User registration and login
  - JWT token-based authentication
  - Role-based access control

- ✅ **API Communication**
  - Frontend can communicate with backend APIs
  - CORS properly configured
  - Error handling implemented

- ✅ **Complaint Management**
  - Create complaints with image upload
  - View user complaints
  - Admin functionality

### 🚀 How to Use

1. **Start Backend** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start Frontend** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   cd frontend/client
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the Application**:
   - Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser
   - The frontend will automatically connect to the backend

### 🔍 Testing

- Backend health check: `http://localhost:5000`
- Frontend application: `http://localhost:5173`
- Integration test: Run `node test-connection.js`

### 📁 Key Files Modified

**Frontend:**
- `frontend/client/package.json` - Updated scripts to use Vite
- `frontend/client/.env` - Set correct API URL
- `frontend/client/src/utils/api.js` - Fixed port configuration

**Backend:**
- `backend/.env` - Environment configuration
- `backend/server.js` - Enhanced CORS settings
- `backend/middleware/authMiddleware.js` - Fixed authentication

### 🎉 Next Steps

Your integration is complete! You can now:
1. Use the application through the web interface
2. Test all features (registration, login, complaints)
3. Customize the application as needed
4. Deploy to production when ready

The frontend and backend are now properly connected and communicating with each other.
